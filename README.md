# 301-Final-Project
Classifying images of cats and dogs with foreground and background

I wrote code that I want to push
git pull --rebase origin master
git add filename.py
git commit -m "message about commit"
git push
--If it doesn't work
git pull
--Algorithm merges for you
git pull --rebase origin master
--put changes into file on your computers
--by hand resolves conflicts

To get rid of local stuff and pull the master branch (get rid of everything not committed)
git reset --hard origin/master
or
git stash -u
